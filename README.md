# MLS
MLS is a mobile app built using React Native and created to make it easier to book surgeon tools for hospitals or help other hospitals to resupply the tools they needed.

This project is built for Marchwood Laboratory Services Pte Ltd and consists of 2 apps i.e. MLS Client and MLS Driver.

My responsibility in this project is doing bug fixes.
